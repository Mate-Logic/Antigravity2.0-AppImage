# Antigravity 2.0 AppImage

[![Build and publish](https://github.com/tyvsmith/Antigravity-AppImage/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tyvsmith/Antigravity-AppImage/actions/workflows/release.yml)

An unofficial, community-maintained AppImage distribution of Google Antigravity
2.0 for Linux x86_64.

## Download

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/tyvsmith/Antigravity-AppImage/releases/latest).
Every release contains the AppImage, its zsync update file, and SHA-256, MD5,
and SHA-512 manifests. The release notes also contain a checksum table for each
published AppImage asset.

This project is not affiliated with Google. The application itself is always
downloaded from the official [Antigravity download page](https://antigravity.google/download).

## Run

```bash
chmod +x Antigravity*.AppImage
./Antigravity*.AppImage
```

AppImage update metadata is embedded in each image. Compatible AppImage
updaters can use the zsync asset from the latest GitHub release.

## Automation

The scheduled workflow runs every six hours and also supports manual runs. A
manual run can set `force` to rebuild the current source and repair or refresh
the latest release metadata. The workflow:

1. Parses the official download page to find the current Antigravity 2.0 Linux x86_64 archive.
2. Downloads the archive and computes its SHA-256 digest.
3. Compares that digest with the `SOURCE-SHA256` asset of the latest release.
4. Stops without publishing when the source bytes have not changed.
5. Passes the expected digest to [`appimage-python`](https://github.com/Mate-Logic/appimage-python), which verifies the archive it downloads before building.
6. Publishes the AppImage, zsync file, checksum manifests, and a release checksum table.

Google currently does not publish a checksum for this archive. The source
digest is therefore an identity for the normalized package used by this project,
not an independently signed vendor attestation. The resolver adds the desktop
icon required by the AppImage builder before calculating that digest.

## Local development

The workflow is the supported reproducible build path because the official
download URL is dynamic. To inspect the resolver locally:

```bash
python3 scripts/resolve-release.py
```

The AppImage is built with the `Mate-Logic/appimage-python` GitHub Action. The
repository intentionally contains only the desktop integration files and the
workflow-specific resolver.
